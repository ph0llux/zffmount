summary: Tool to fuse-mount zff files.
description: |
  zffmount is a tool to mount zff files with FUSE.

  Zff (Z forensic file format) is a completley new designed file format to store and handle the contents and structure 
  of a partial or entire disk image or physical memory. The focus of zff is on speed, security and modularity in concert 
  with forensic requirements. The modular design promises high maintainability and scalability. Zff is an alternative 
  to the ewf and aff file formats and is not compatible with them.
