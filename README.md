# Installation

First, you need to [install rust and cargo](https://rustup.rs/) to build or install ```zffmount```.
Then you can easily build this tool yourself by using cargo:
```bash
[/home/ph0llux/projects/zffmount] $ cargo build --release
```
Or you can install the tool directly from crates.io:
```bash
$ cargo install zffmount
```


# Planned features until zffmount reaches version 1.0
- capability to handle keyfiles for zff image decryption
